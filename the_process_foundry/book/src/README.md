# The Process Foundry

Welcome to The Process Foundry (TPF), a business process model and notation (BPMN) based microservice
framework.

Be warned, like all frameworks it will suck. Read ahead to see if it can be made to suck less for you.

The goal of this projects is to create a backbone to implement inter-process communications between disparate
processes on so the developer can focus on their code rather than digging into every niggling decision that
goes into a microservice.

It is designed to be composable, but with sane defaults that the dev will never even know about unless
they go looking.
