# ELK Stack

That's Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack). Reliably and securely take data from any source, in any format, then search, analyze, and visualize it in real time.

This is going to be the default lagging mechanism for The Process Foundry, so I'm including it as since we
can install the whole thing in a Docker Compose/MiniKube instance.
